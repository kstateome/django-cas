## How to Contribute

Fork and branch off of the ``develop`` branch.  Submit Pull requests back to ``kstateome:develop``.

## Settings.py for CAS

Add the following to middleware if you want to use CAS::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    'cas.middleware.CASMiddleware',
    )


Add these to ``settings.py`` to use the CAS Backend::


    CAS_SERVER_URL = "Your Cas Server"
    CAS_LOGOUT_COMPLETELY = True
    CAS_PROVIDE_URL_TO_LOGOUT = True

# Additional Features

This fork contains additional features not found in the original:
*  Proxied Hosts
*  CAS Response Callbacks
*  CAS Gateway
*  Proxy Tickets (From Edmund Crewe)

## Proxied Hosts

You will need to setup middleware to handle the use of proxies.

Add a setting ``PROXY_DOMAIN`` of the domain you want the client to use.  Then add

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    'cas.middleware.ProxyMiddleware',
    )

This middleware needs to be added before the django ``common`` middleware.


## CAS Response Callbacks

To store data from CAS, create a callback function that accepts the ElementTree object from the
proxyValidate response. There can be multiple callbacks, and they can live anywhere. Define the
callback(s) in ``settings.py``:

    CAS_RESPONSE_CALLBACKS = (
        'path.to.module.callbackfunction',
        'anotherpath.to.module.callbackfunction2',
    )

and create the functions in ``path/to/module.py``:

    def callbackfunction(tree):
        username = tree[0][0].text

        user, user_created = User.objects.get_or_create(username=username)
        profile, created = user.get_profile()

        profile.email = tree[0][1].text
        profile.position = tree[0][2].text
        profile.save()


## CAS Gateway

To use the CAS Gateway feature, first enable it in settings. Trying to use it without explicitly
enabling this setting will raise an ImproperlyConfigured:

    CAS_GATEWAY = True

Then, add the ``gateway`` decorator to a view:

    from cas.decorators import gateway

    @gateway()
    def foo(request):
        #stuff
        return render(request, 'foo/bar.html')


## Custom Forbidden Page

To show a custom forbidden page, set ``CAS_CUSTOM_FORBIDDEN`` to a ``path.to.some_view``.  Otherwise,
a generic ``HttpResponseForbidden`` will be returned.


## Proxy Tickets

This fork also includes
[Edmund Crewe's proxy ticket patch](http://code.google.com/r/edmundcrewe-proxypatch/source/browse/django-cas-proxy.patch).
